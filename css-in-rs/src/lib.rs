//! A library for embedding dynamic CSS in Rust (wasm); inspired by [cssinjs/jss](https://cssinjs.org/)
//!
//! This crate is designed to be framework-independent.
//! It currently provides integrations for [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), which is disabled by default.
//!
//! ## Use case
//! This crate allows to develop reusable components for the web which bundle their own
//! styles. Thanks to dead-code-analysis in Rust, only the styles which are actually used will be included
//! in the final wasm binary.
//!
//! Features:
//! * A procmacro [make_styles!] to write css directly in Rust
//! * A runtime to inject the styles on a as-need basis. If styles are not used, they
//!   won't be included in the final binary
//! * Styles will only be mounted once, even if requested multiple times
//! * Dynamically created classnames to avoid collisions. You can choose common names
//!   like `active` for multiple components without problems
//! * Compile time checks: Rust will warn you if classnames defined in your styles are
//!   never used. If they don't exist, you'll get an error
//!
//! ## Basic idea
//! You embed your CSS code with classnames of your choice using the [make_styles!] procmacro.
//! It will generate a new rust `struct` for the final runtime-names of the used css classes.
//! For each css class in your style, a `classname: String` member will be available in the struct.
//! See the documentation for [make_styles!] for more details.
//!
//! Styles generated this way can be mounted. On the first mount, classnames are generated at runtime
//! to avoid collisions and returned in the struct created by the procmacro. You can therefore access
//! the created classnames using the struct. Since the struct's type is generated at compile time,
//! the compiler will complain if you use undefined css classes and warn you about unused classes.
//!
//! Styles are only mounted once. You can try to do it repeatedly, but it will be a no-op. You'll get
//! a reference to the classnames-struct which was created the first time. Therefore, you can reuse
//! your created styles in many components, and you do no not need to worry about mounting them too
//! many times.
//!
//! #### Example (Dioxus):
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "dioxus")] {
//! #![allow(non_snake_case)]
//!
//! use css_in_rs::{Classes, EmptyTheme, make_styles, use_style_provider_quickstart};
//! use dioxus::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Will create a new struct `MyClasses` with three members:
//! //  `red_text`, `primary` and `disabled`
//! make_styles! {
//!     (_theme: EmptyTheme) -> MyClasses {
//!         red_text {          // defines a new css class: `red_text`
//!             color: "red",
//!             margin: "5px",
//!         },
//!         "button" {          // does not define any new css classes
//!             margin: "5px",
//!             padding: "5px",
//!             width: "10em",
//!         },
//!         "button.primary" {  // defines a new css class: `primary`
//!             border: "2px solid red",
//!         },
//!         "button.disabled" { // Shows a rust warning: "field never read"
//!             disabled: true,
//!         },
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn Demo(cx: Scope) -> Element {
//!     let classes: &MyClasses = MyClasses::use_style(cx);
//!
//!     render! {
//!         div {
//!             class: &classes.red_text as &str,
//!             "This text is supposed to be red.",
//!         }
//!         button {
//!             class: &classes.primary as &str,
//!             "Click me",
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
//!     use_style_provider_quickstart(cx, || EmptyTheme);
//!
//!     cx.render(rsx! {
//!         Demo {}
//!     })
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // launch the web app
//!     dioxus_web::launch(App);
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
